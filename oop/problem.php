<!-- 
    * Create a base class Product with properties like name, price, and description.

    * Create derived classes like PhysicalProduct (with additional properties like weight and dimensions) and DigitalProduct (with additional properties like downloadLink).

    * Write a program that creates objects of these classes, setting their specific properties, and demonstrates how inheritance helps categorize product types.

<!-- 
    * Create a base class Employee with properties like name, department, and a method calculateSalary() (which can be empty in the base class).

    * Create derived classes like Manager, Developer, and Salesperson that inherit from Employee and implement their specific calculateSalary() methods based on different criteria.

    * Write a program that creates objects of these classes, sets their information, and calls calculateSalary() on each object (you can use a placeholder value for now).
